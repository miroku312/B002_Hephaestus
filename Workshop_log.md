This repository documents the hands-on development of B002_Hephaestus, it is a modular robotic arm platform. The focus here is on mechanical construction, motion control, and practical integration rather than theoretical robotics.
Entries are expected to be added gradually as the system takes shape.
Early work concentrates on:
- joint layout and range of motion
- load handling at different arm positions
- rigidity versus weight trade-offs
- cable routing and strain relief
